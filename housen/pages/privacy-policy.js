                            </h4>
                            <p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets
                                Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you provide through the website. We restrict
                                authorised access to your personal information to those persons who have a legitimate purpose
                                to know that information and to those persons you have authorised to have access to that
                                information. Housen.ca follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal
                                information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Housen.ca receives it. No
                                method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
                                Therefore, while Housen.ca strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                                personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will not sell, distribute, or
                                lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required
                                by law to do so.</p>

                            <p>Users who provide information through our website, as data subjects and data owners, have the
                                right to access, rectify, download or delete their information, as well as to restrict and object to
                                certain processing of their information. While some of these rights apply generally, others apply
                                only in certain limited circumstances. We describe these rights below:</p>
                            <ul className="">
                                    <li>Access and portability: to access and know what information is stored in our servers, you
                                    can send us your request through our contact information.</li>
                                    <li>Rectify, Restrict, Limit and/or Delete: You can also rectify, restrict, limit or delete much of
                                    your information.</li>
                                    <li>Right to be informed: Users of our website will be informed, upon request, about what data
                                    we collect, how it is used, how long it is retained and whether it is shared with third parties.</li>
                                    <li>Object: When we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained
                                    above, or in the public interest, you may object to this processing in certain circumstances.
                                    In such cases, we will stop processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate
                                    reasons to continue processing it or where it is necessary for legal reasons.</li>
                                    <li>Revoke consent: Where you have previously given your consent, such as to allow us to
                                    process and store your personal information, you have the right to revoke your consent to
                                    the processing and storage of your information at any time. For example, you may withdraw
                                    your consent by updating your settings. In certain cases, we may continue to process your
                                    information after you have withdrawn your consent if we have a legal basis for doing so or
                                    if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.</li>
                                    <li>Complaint: If you wish to file a complaint about our use of your information (and without
                                    prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local
                                    supervisory authority. Users can exercise all these rights by contacting us through the
                                    contact information or the contact page.</li>
                                    <li> Rights related to automated decision-making, including profiling: website users may
                                    request that we provide a copy of the automated processing activities we conduct if they
                                    believe that data is being unlawfully processed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Users may exercise their rights in relation to the personal data they provide to Housen.ca, at any
                                time, by sending us their request through our contact information and we will process and
